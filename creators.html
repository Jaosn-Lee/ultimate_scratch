                     viewed and liked(the #1 scratch project is his) and he has been doing this since 2013!
                     Griffpatch is the goat and soul of youtube, and it's most important creator.

                        <p>Just like normal minecraft! but in 2d, it's crazy how he basically made a game that took a 
                        whole company to make other than the graphics. it's the most viewed, liked, starred project
                        that ever made the platform. It's iconic and I still remember playing it during the pandemic
                        lol.

                <p>Will wam is a OG scratcher. We all remember the ninja series and the bouncy ninja series.
                    He actually made an app on ios and android I think on the bouncy ninja. Recently because

                        <p>The ninja is a classic scratch game, it's a platformer where you have to learn to use 
                            different weapons to defeat enemies along the way, there are a lot of series to this
                            (all the way to 5!).

                            around defending yourself with surikens and katanas against enemy ninjas, the bouncy
                            ninja is a well improved version of the bouncy ninja

                    iconic scratch games and goofy games with his unique style of graphics and game making elements,
                    you can instantly tell a game is made by him. And his animatiosn are really fun and interesting
